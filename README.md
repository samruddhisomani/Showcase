A survey of my previous exploits and adventures in data science, descending in recency.

## Collaborations and Presentations

- [R ggplot introduction](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/ggplot2Intro/blob/master/introduction_pres.pdf): A ggplot introduction presented at R-Ladies Austin March 1, 2017


## Projects

- [Predicting Cuisine from Ingredients (Advanced Predictive Modeling)\*](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/Showcase/blob/master/Samples/No%20Free%20Lunch.pdf) [Repository](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/Cuisine)

  _In this presentation, we examine the Yummly data set on Kaggle and analyze whether cuisines can accurately be predicted using just cuisine ingredients without recipe amounts or instructions. We build a variety of models, each of which is roughly 75% accurate, and then combine these into a competitive ensemble that has 78% accuracy, impressive considering the we are categorizing 20 different cuisine classes._
  
- [Presidential Campaigns (Marketing Analytics)\*](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/Showcase/blob/master/Samples/Presidential%20Campaigns.pdf) [Repository](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/MKT_Elections)

  _In this presentation, we model the 'swinginess' of a state--to what extent it will be a swing state in that the vote share will be split fairly evenly between Republicans and Democrats. This metric has a 62% correlation with ad spending. We next examine the interaction of swinginess and ad spending: This metric has a 99% correlation with ad spending. We see that ad money should be spent in states with a high level of swinginess and a high number of electoral votes._

- [Public Media and Information Poverty (Senior Thesis)](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/Showcase/blob/master/Samples/Public%20Media%20and%20Information%20Poverty.pdf)

  _In this paper, I use exploratory data analysis techniques to understand whether publically funded media does service otherwise underserved language communities. I study historical BBC data in English, Hindi, and Urdu to determine whether stories are written especially for each language or simply translated. My research indicates that stories are written separately. Visualizations explaining the evidence--both Google Charts and R ggplot2 graphics--begin on page 15._

- [Equalizing Access to College (Congressional Advisory Board Report)](https://github.com/samruddhisomani/Showcase/blob/master/Samples/Equalizing%20Access%20to%20College%20Education.pdf)

  _In this paper, I synthesize a variety of data sources to show empirically that funding undergraduate education via federal grants benefits both individual Americans and American society as a whole. I first examine how a college education affects life after college and then how affordability impacts college attendance._
